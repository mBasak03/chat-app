// this Conversation refers to room, where in a conversation there are two peoples talking to each others, i mean so many messages. So for each conversation there are many messages. This is a one-to-many relation from Conversation to Message

// Now, when its come between Conversation and User, One user can have multiple Conversations with multiple other peoples. So from User's prpspective this is a one-to-many relationship. On other side this is a one-to-one conversation app. So, for each Conversation there will be to User envolved. So, from Conversation Model prospective this is a one-to-many relationship. finally it is a many-to-many relationship between Conversation and User model.

// for User-Message relation ship, this is also a one-to-many relationship. Because one can send multiple message to multiple other users. and for one message there will be only one sender/user.
